# Hi there, I'm Dhruv! 👋

I am a Full Stack Developer driven by the challenge of making complex systems simple and fast. My focus is on scalability and performance whether I'm optimizing a backend with Node.js or architecting seamless real-time experiences. I don't just write code; I engineer solutions that work.
